title: Relating Peptide Sequence and Self-Assembly Behavior with Computational Molecular Dynamics
description: As an undergraduate researcher, I performed all-atom molecular dynamics simulations using AMBER to study hydrogel behavior at the atomic scale, with particular emphasis on pentapeptide-driven self-assembly. I prepared and formatted setup files for over 100 simulations, enabling controlled, systematic comparisons of peptide sequences and simulation parameters to assess their influence on hydrogel formation. I applied Python-based analysis workflows to compute intermolecular contact metrics and to visualize molecular interactions and aggregation behavior. In parallel with computational analysis, I participated in manuscript reviews, project analyses, and cross-laboratory research discussions, and regularly presented technical research updates in both small-group and multi-lab meetings. I also generated supplementary figures and contributed written sections to a manuscript currently under peer review.
